## Features

1. This Application Allows users to classify and analyze their product feedback.
2. The scope and scalalibity of this application is huge in the sense that any user can simply change the input data and be able to use the app 
3. The feedback is segregated on sentiment analysis, word repetition and Natural Language Processing, etc.

## Running

To test the application run the following commands on your terminal:

**Running the application locally:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**On docker:**

```
docker-compose up --build
```
